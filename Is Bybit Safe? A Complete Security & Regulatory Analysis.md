# Is Bybit Safe? A Deep Dive Into Its Security, Regulations, and Trustworthiness

The safety and legitimacy of cryptocurrency exchanges are critical concerns for traders and investors. With increasing cases of cyberattacks, scams, and regulatory crackdowns, evaluating whether an exchange is secure is essential before depositing funds. One such prominent crypto trading platform is Bybit—a platform known for its derivatives trading, futures contracts, and high-leverage offerings.

Since its inception in 2018, Bybit has gained significant traction among traders worldwide, but is Bybit safe to use? This article provides a detailed, in-depth analysis of Bybit’s security measures, compliance with global regulations, past incidents, and overall reputation in the crypto industry.

## Bybit’s Security Infrastructure: How Safe Are User Funds?

Bybit has built a comprehensive security framework to safeguard users' digital assets, ensuring protection against cyber threats and fraudulent activities. Below are the key elements of Bybit’s security infrastructure:

### 1. Cold Wallet Storage: Protecting User Funds
Bybit implements a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) cold wallet system, meaning that the majority of user funds are stored offline. Unlike hot wallets, which remain connected to the internet and are more vulnerable to hacks, cold wallets minimize exposure to cyber threats.

- Over 95% of Bybit’s assets are stored in cold wallets, ensuring maximum security.
- Only a small portion is kept in hot wallets for daily withdrawals and liquidity purposes.
- Multi-signature authentication is required before transferring funds from cold wallets, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized transactions.

### 2. Multi-Signature Wallets: Preventing Unauthorized Access
Bybit’s multi-signature (multi-sig) technology ensures that no single person or system can execute a transaction alone. Instead, multiple approvals are required before funds are moved.

- This mechanism prevents insider threats and reduces the risk of unauthorized fund transfers.
- In case of a security breach, attackers cannot access funds unless multiple key holders approve transactions.
- Bybit’s multi-sig system is automated, eliminating human errors that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

### 3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
To enhance user security, Bybit requires two-factor authentication (2FA) for the following activities:

✔️ Logging into accounts  
✔️ Withdrawing funds  
✔️ Resetting security settings  

Users must enable 2FA via Google Authenticator to perform critical account actions. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if login credentials are compromised.

### 4. Anti-Phishing Codes
Phishing scams are a common method hackers use to trick users into revealing sensitive information. Bybit combats this by incorporating anti-phishing codes in official emails, allowing users to verify if an email is genuinely from Bybit.

- Users set a unique anti-phishing code in their account settings.
- Any official email from Bybit will contain this code, making it easier to identify legitimate communications.
- If an email lacks the anti-phishing code, users are advised to ignore and report it.

### 5. Whitelisting Withdrawal Addresses
Bybit offers a withdrawal address whitelisting feature, allowing users to specify trusted wallet addresses for withdrawals.

- Once whitelisted, Bybit blocks all withdrawal attempts to unapproved addresses.
- This feature prevents hackers from diverting funds to unauthorized wallets in case of a compromised account.
- To enhance security, any change to the withdrawal whitelist requires email and 2FA confirmation.

## Is Bybit Regulated? A Look at Its Compliance and Licensing

Regulatory compliance is a crucial factor in determining the legitimacy and safety of a crypto exchange. Bybit operates under several regulatory authorities but remains unlicensed in some major jurisdictions.

### 1. Bybit’s Regulatory Licenses
Bybit has secured licenses in multiple jurisdictions, strengthening its legal standing:

- **VARA (Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority):** Ensures compliance with UAE virtual asset regulations.
- **CySEC (Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission):** Oversees Bybit’s operations in Europe under EU financial laws.
- **AFSA (Astana Financial Services Authority, Kazakhstan):** Regulates Bybit’s crypto-related services in Kazakhstan.

### 2. Countries Where Bybit Is Restricted
Despite its regulatory licenses, Bybit is not legally permitted to operate in certain countries due to strict financial regulations.

❌ **United States** – Bybit is not registered with the SEC or CFTC.  
❌ **United Kingdom** – Due to FCA restrictions, UK residents cannot use Bybit’s derivatives services.

## Bybit’s Security Breach: What Happened in 2025?

In February 2025, Bybit experienced one of the biggest security breaches in cryptocurrency history, leading to the theft of **$1.5 billion** in crypto assets.

### How the Hack Occurred
